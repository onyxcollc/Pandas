* Part 1: The task was to create a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of sevreal portfolios in ranges of volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. Historical daily returns of several portfolios where given, some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, and some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, also some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 

* Part 2: Then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500).
